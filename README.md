# MedPod-Interview-Coding-Challenge

*** Create a React application that streams audio between two users and allows basic audio manipulation. The challenge is divided into three steps, with each step increasing in complexity. You can complete as many steps as you're comfortable with, but completing all of them will showcase your full range of skills. ***

<li> Step 1 <b> <i> (Core Requirement) </i> </b>: <br> 
<li> Build a simple audio streaming feature between two users using WebRTC or any other preferred method. </li> 
</li>

<li> Step 2 <i> (Optional/Bonus) </i>:
<li> Implement a basic frequency and gain filter on the audio stream. </li>
<li> The filter should be set to gain of .75 and a frequency range of 0-200 HZ. </li>
<li> Users should be able to toggle the filter on and off while the audio is streaming. </li>
</li>

<li> Step 3 <i> (Advanced/Extra Credit) </i>:
<li> Visualize the audio stream as a waveform or frequency spectrum. </li>
<li> The visualization should update in real-time as the audio plays. </li>
</li>

** Submission Guidelines: **
<li> Submit your code via a GitHub repository link. </li>
<li> Include a brief explanation of your approach, tools used, and any challenges you encountered. </li>
<li> Focus on clean, modular, and maintainable code.
